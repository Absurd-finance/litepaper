# Absurd Finance: The credit card web3 needs

**Introduction**

In recent times, newer generations have faced increasing hurdles in accessing credit due to lower wages, job instability, and an ensuing widespread lack of credit history. Traditional financial institutions, wary of high interest rates imposed by central banks and geopolitical instability, have become reluctant to extend credit, thereby exacerbating the issue. Moreover, loan originators often regard individuals involved in web3 with a degree of scepticism, posing further challenges for these individuals by demanding higher assurances or completely refusing them as customers. Absurd Finance, through an innovative approach, seeks to address these challenges. By amalgamating open banking and on-chain data, it accurately assesses borrowing power and provides uncollateralised revolving credit lines to vetted borrowers linked to a credit card. In this way, Absurd Finance presents the first credit card with a complete DeFi-powered backend.

This white paper delves into Absurd Finance's avant-garde approach to credit, aiming to promote financial inclusivity and empower the web3 community to attain greater financial freedom.

**The Unfolding Credit Crisis**

The financial landscape has evolved dramatically, with the purchasing power of younger generations, including GenZ, experiencing a marked decline in recent times. Low wages, job instability, and fragmented earnings have led to a lack of credit availability for many individuals. Simple expenses, such as buying an expensive garment, have transformed into an elusive luxury for a significant portion of the population.

GenZ, in comparison to the baby boomer generation, grapples with more significant obstacles when it comes to credit access. This economic disparity has led to a considerable decline in their purchasing power, impeding their ability to participate in various experiences and fulfil aspirations that were once taken for granted. Consequently, a growing divide is emerging between those who are financially privileged and those struggling to secure credit for their needs.

Millennials, reacting to this shifting financial environment, have shown a preference for spreading sizeable expenses over several months, as opposed to making immediate payments. This change in spending habits has triggered a surge in 'Buy Now Pay Later' (BNPL) services, such as Klarna or Scalapay, and a growing reliance on credit cards to manage expenses. Even the EU market, traditionally hostile to credit, is gradually accepting BNPL and credit cards as convenient and accessible means of financing.

Despite its rapid growth and innovation, the crypto industry is not exempt from unique hurdles in the realm of credit access. Traditional credit institutions often dismiss cryptocurrencies as a form of gambling and tend to overlook on-chain assets or salaries when evaluating potential borrowers, to the extent of treating these factors as red flags. This bias has thwarted the potential integration of crypto assets as a viable path in the lending process.

**Uncollateralised Lending in Web3**

In the existing blockchain financial system, or "web3", the predominant form of lending is collateralised. This means that borrowers are required to over-collateralise their loans by putting up more in assets than they're borrowing. While this approach mitigates risk for lenders, it presents a considerable barrier for a majority of potential borrowers who may not have sufficient collateral to offer.

Uncollateralised lending, on the other hand, removes the need for borrowers to secure loans with collateral, thereby allowing a broader range of individuals and businesses to access needed funds. This approach becomes increasingly important in web3, where a large part of the user base may primarily hold or earn their wealth in crypto assets, which are not conventionally considered by traditional banks as viable collateral.

The advent of uncollateralised lending in web3 opens up new opportunities for these individuals to access credit, encouraging economic activity and fostering growth in the digital economy. By assessing creditworthiness using a combination of traditional financial data and on-chain metrics, protocols like Absurd Finance aim to make uncollateralised lending a reality in web3, promoting financial inclusivity and the democratisation of finance.

**Lending as a Driver of Economic Growth**

Lending, in both traditional and digital economies, plays a crucial role in stimulating economic growth. It serves as a catalyst for a variety of economic activities, from consumer spending and business investment to entrepreneurial initiatives and innovation.

In essence, lending facilitates the flow of money from those who have a surplus (savers or investors) to those who need extra funds (borrowers). This flow of funds is essential for both business development and consumer spending. Businesses, whether small start-ups or large corporations, often rely on loans to finance expansions, acquire necessary equipment, or invest in research and development. Similarly, consumers use credit for a variety of purposes, including purchasing homes, cars, and other goods, or funding education.

When businesses can invest in growth and consumers can spend more, it leads to an increase in production, job creation, and overall economic activity. Additionally, the interest paid on these loans provides a return for savers and investors, further encouraging saving and investment.

In a nutshell, lending, and particularly uncollateralised lending, is a critical component in fuelling economic growth. As digital economies continue to grow and evolve, protocols like Absurd Finance are setting the stage for this transformative economic activity to expand into web3. By embracing uncollateralised lending, they not only drive economic growth in the digital world, but also ensure that this growth is inclusive and accessible to all.
